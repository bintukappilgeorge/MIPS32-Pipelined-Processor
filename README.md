# MIPS32 Pipelined Processor

## Introduction

This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor in Verilog. The processor executes a subset of MIPS32 instructions and follows a two-phase clocking scheme. It supports arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instructions while handling hazards and ensuring instruction flow efficiency.
